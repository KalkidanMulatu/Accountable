# Accountable
Our application is intended for teachers to have an organized environment to handle all their student's parents contact information. Teachers are able to organize their students by their corressponding 
class. For each student, a teacher is able to make comments about the student, and if it's an urgent comment the teacher is able to send it through an SMS text message directly to their parent.

Motivation:
One of the developers behind the application used to be a teacher. He said one of the more challenging things was always having parents contact information on hand and mainting a streamlined
form of communication with the parents.
